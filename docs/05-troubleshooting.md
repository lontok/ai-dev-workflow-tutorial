## Installation Issues

### "Command not found" after installing a tool

**Symptoms:**
```
zsh: command not found: uv
bash: git: command not found
```

**Cause:** The terminal doesn't know where to find the newly installed program.

**Solutions:**

1. **Restart Cursor** — Close Cursor completely and reopen it

2. **Reload shell configuration:**
   - macOS: `source ~/.zshrc` or `source ~/.bashrc`
   - Windows: Restart PowerShell

3. **Check if the tool is in PATH:**
   ```bash
   echo $PATH
   ```
   The installation directory should be listed.

4. **Reinstall the tool** — Sometimes installation is incomplete

---

### Python version is wrong after installation

**Symptoms:**
```
$ python --version
Python 2.7.x  # or Python 3.8.x when you need 3.11+
```

**Solutions:**

**macOS:**
- Use `python3` instead of `python`:
  ```bash
  python3 --version
  ```
- If you have multiple versions, use the specific version:
  ```bash
  python3.11 --version
  ```

**Windows:**
- Ensure "Add Python to PATH" was checked during installation
- Reinstall Python from python.org with this option checked
- Use the Python launcher:
  ```bash
  py -3.11 --version
  ```

---

### npm/Node.js not found

**Symptoms:**
```
npm: command not found
```

**Solutions:**

1. **Install Node.js:**
   - Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
   - Download and install the LTS version
   - Restart Cursor

2. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```

---

## Git Issues

### "Not a git repository"

**Symptoms:**
```
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
```

**Cause:** You are not inside a Git repository folder.

**Solutions:**

1. **Navigate to the correct folder:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/Documents/ai-dev-workflow-tutorial
   ```

2. **Check you are in the right place:**
   ```bash
   ls -la
   ```
   You should see a `.git` folder listed.

3. **If you haven't cloned yet:** Follow the clone steps in Session 1.

---

### Git asks for password repeatedly

**Symptoms:**
- Every `git push` or `git pull` asks for username/password
- Password doesn't work (GitHub no longer accepts passwords)

**Solutions:**

1. **Use a Personal Access Token (PAT):**
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
   - Generate a new token with `repo` permissions
   - Use this token as your password

2. **Cache credentials:**
   ```bash
   git config --global credential.helper store
   ```
   Then enter credentials once; they will be saved.

3. **Use SSH instead of HTTPS** (more advanced):
   - Generate SSH key: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519`
   - Add key to GitHub: Settings → SSH and GPG keys
   - Clone using SSH URL

---

### "Your branch is behind"

**Symptoms:**
```
Your branch is behind 'origin/main' by 3 commits
```

**Cause:** The remote repository has changes you don't have locally.

**Solution:**
```bash
git pull origin main
```

If you have local changes that conflict, Git will tell you. Ask Claude Code for help resolving conflicts.

---

## GitHub Issues

### Can't push — "Permission denied"

**Symptoms:**
```
remote: Permission to user/repo.git denied
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/...'
```

**Cause:** You don't have write access to the repository.

**Solutions:**

1. **Make sure you are pushing to YOUR fork**, not the original repo:
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```
   The URL should include your GitHub username.

2. **If the URL is wrong, fix it:**
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ai-dev-workflow-tutorial.git
   ```

3. **Authenticate properly** — Use a Personal Access Token or SSH.

---

## Advanced Git Issues (Capstone)

These issues relate to branching and pull requests, which you'll use in your capstone projects.

### Pull request can't be merged — conflicts

**Symptoms:**
- GitHub shows "This branch has conflicts that must be resolved"

**Cause:** Changes in main conflict with your branch.

**Solution:**

1. Update your branch with main:
   ```bash
   git checkout feature/ECOM-1-my-feature
   git fetch origin
   git merge origin/main
   ```

2. If there are conflicts, Git will mark them in the files
3. Ask Claude Code: "Help me resolve the merge conflicts in my files"
4. After resolving, commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "ECOM-1: resolve merge conflicts"
   git push
   ```

---

### Accidentally committed to main

**Symptoms:**
- You made commits directly to `main` instead of a feature branch

**Solution:**

If you haven't pushed yet:
```bash
# Create a new branch with your commits
git branch feature/ECOM-1-my-feature

# Reset main to match remote
git checkout main
git reset --hard origin/main

# Switch to your feature branch
git checkout feature/ECOM-1-my-feature
```

If you already pushed, ask Claude Code for help — the solution depends on your specific situation.

---

## Jira Issues

### Can't create project — "Key already exists"

**Symptoms:**
- Error when creating project with key ECOM

**Solution:**
- Choose a different project key (e.g., ECOM2, MYECOM)
- Update your commit messages to use the new key

---

### GitHub integration not showing in Jira

**Symptoms:**
- No "Development" panel on Jira issues
- Commits/PRs not linked

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify app is installed:**
   - Jira Settings → Apps → Manage apps
   - Find "GitHub for Jira"

2. **Check repository connection:**
   - Click Configure on the GitHub for Jira app
   - Ensure your repository is selected

3. **Wait a few minutes** — synchronization can be slow

4. **Verify commit message format:**
   - Must include Jira key: `ECOM-1: description`

---

## Claude Code Issues

### Authentication fails

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: Authentication required
```

**Solutions:**

1. **Log out and back in:**
   ```bash
   claude logout
   claude
   ```

2. **Allow browser popups** — The auth flow opens a browser window

3. **Check subscription** — Ensure Claude Pro is active at claude.ai

---

### "API rate limit exceeded"

**Symptoms:**
- Claude stops responding
- Error about rate limits or quota

**Solutions:**

1. **Wait** — Limits reset periodically (typically every 5 hours)

2. **Upgrade to Max** — If you need more capacity ($100/month)

3. **Work in smaller chunks** — Break your requests into smaller pieces

---

### Claude Code seems slow

**Solutions:**

1. **Simplify your request** — Complex multi-file requests take longer

2. **Be more specific** — Vague requests require more processing

3. **Check your internet connection**

---

## Spec-Kit Issues

### "specify: command not found"

**Solution:**

Reinstall spec-kit:
```bash
uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git
```

Then restart your terminal.

---

### Spec-kit commands don't work in Claude Code

**Symptoms:**
- `/speckit.specify` doesn't do anything

**Solutions:**

1. **Make sure you initialized spec-kit:**
   ```bash
   specify init . --ai claude
   ```

2. **Try alternative syntax:**
   - Instead of `/speckit.specify`, describe what you want:
   - "Use spec-kit to create a specification for the dashboard"

---

## Python/Streamlit Issues

### "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'streamlit'"

**Cause:** Streamlit is not installed in your current environment.

**Solutions:**

1. **Activate your virtual environment:**
   - macOS: `source venv/bin/activate`
   - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`

2. **Install the dependency:**
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit
   ```

3. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   pip list | grep streamlit
   ```

---

### "Port 8501 is already in use"

**Cause:** Streamlit is already running in another terminal.

**Solutions:**

1. **Use a different port:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502
   ```

2. **Find and kill the existing process:**
   - macOS/Linux: `lsof -i :8501` then `kill <PID>`
   - Windows: `netstat -ano | findstr :8501` then `taskkill /PID <PID> /F`

---

### Dashboard shows no data or errors

**Solutions:**

1. **Check CSV path:**
   - Is `data/sales-data.csv` in the right place?
   - Is the path in your code correct?

2. **Check CSV format:**
   - Open the CSV and verify it has the expected columns
   - Ask Claude: "Read data/sales-data.csv and tell me its structure"

3. **Check for errors:**
   - Look at the terminal where Streamlit is running
   - Error messages appear there

---

## MCP Connection Issues

### Atlassian MCP not connecting

**Symptoms:**
- `/mcp` doesn't show `atlassian`
- Claude can't access Jira

**Solutions:**

1. **Re-add the MCP server:**
   ```bash
   claude mcp add --transport sse atlassian https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/sse
   ```

2. **Complete authentication in browser** — Don't close the popup

3. **Check your Atlassian account** — Make sure you can log into Jira directly

4. **Try again later** — MCP servers occasionally have issues

---

### "MCP server disconnected"

**Solution:**

Exit and restart Claude Code:
```bash
/exit
claude
```

The MCP connection should re-establish.

---

## General Debugging Tips

### Ask Claude Code for help

Claude Code can diagnose most issues. Try:

```
I'm getting this error: [paste error message]

I was trying to: [describe what you were doing]

How do I fix this?
```

### Read error messages carefully

Error messages usually tell you:
- What went wrong
- Which file has the problem
- What line number

### Check the basics

Before diving deep:
- Are you in the right directory?
- Is your virtual environment activated?
- Did you save your files?
- Did you restart after installing tools?

### Use `git status` frequently

`git status` tells you:
- What files have changed
- What is staged for commit
- Whether you have commits to push

If you are unsure what state your repository is in, start with `git status`.

## Still Stuck?

1. **Describe the problem to Claude Code** — It can often diagnose and fix issues

2. **Search online** — Error messages are often searchable

3. **Post in Teams** with:
   - What you were trying to do
   - The exact error message (copy/paste, don't paraphrase)
   - What you have already tried
   - Screenshots if helpful

4. **Ask during office hours** for complex issues
